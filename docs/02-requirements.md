## Working in iterations

In each iteration we will build enough functionality to satisfy - to an extent - the requirements of all our stories in the first release.

We will work in iterations, each taking a fixed amount of time and giving us a slightly better version of the product

Code at the end of each iteration needs to be prod-ready
