## Preamble - Cloud-native applications
Cloud-native applications are chosen to:
- To achieve high-availability while running in fault-prone environments;
- To allow us to continuously release new versions with zero downtime;
- To handle dynamic workloads (e.g. request volumes).

Running a replicated application influences our approach to data persistence. Avoid using the local filesystem as primary storage solution, instead rely on databases.

## Installing the Rust toolchain
- rustup [https://rustup.rs/]
- compilation targets (list of targets here)[https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html]
- release channels
  - stable (6-weekly release)
  - beta (candidate)
    - Testing on beta is a good way to support the rust project
  - nightly (built from rust master branch) (unstable)

See installed toolchains:
```bash
rustup toolchain list
```

## Project setup
Check rust compiler version:
```bash
rustc --version
```

Interface for dealing with the rust compiler, `cargo`:
```bash
cargo --version
```

Create new project
```bash
cargo new zero2prod
```
